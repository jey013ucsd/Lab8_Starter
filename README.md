Graceful degradation is the principle of building an application with functionality that can still operate under reduced conditions such as without internet connection. Service workers support this concept by allowing a web application to continue functioning even when the network is unavailable. While the full experience may rely on internet access, service workers cache essential resources so the core functionality degrades gracefully, ensuring usability in offline conditions.
